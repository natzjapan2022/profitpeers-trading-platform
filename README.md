# ProfitPeers Trading Site

A modern Next.js trading platform website built with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components.

## ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT: Text Visibility Guidelines

### Critical Issue: White Text on Light Backgrounds
**ALWAYS** check text visibility when making changes. This project previously had critical issues with white text appearing on white/light backgrounds, making content completely unreadable.

### Text Visibility Checklist
Before deploying any changes, verify:

- [ ] All text has sufficient contrast against its background
- [ ] No white text on white/light backgrounds
- [ ] Stats numbers and labels are clearly visible
- [ ] CTA sections have readable text
- [ ] Button text maintains proper contrast
- [ ] Gradient backgrounds don't wash out text

### Color Guidelines
- **Dark backgrounds** (`blue-700`, `blue-800`, `gray-800`): Use `text-white` or `text-blue-50`
- **Light backgrounds** (`white`, `gray-50`, `blue-50`): Use `text-gray-900`, `text-black`, or `text-blue-900`
- **Gradient backgrounds**: Test text visibility across the entire gradient

### Recently Fixed Issues
- Stats section: "150+ Active Traders", "95% Success Rate", "24/7 Market Coverage"
- CTA sections: "Ready to Transform Your Trading?"
- Pricing badges: "Best Value" labels
- Primary color issues: Replaced undefined `primary-*` classes with `blue-*` classes
